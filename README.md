# Sample A2C class for continuous state and action space

**A2C.py** is a contains the actor-critic class that creates an Deep-RL agent using A2C (advantage actor-critic). Tensorflow is used for the DNNs. Also included is an example on how to use the class with **main.py** and **agent.py**, the aim of the agent is to reach a goal position (no obstacles, this was used as a sanity check).
